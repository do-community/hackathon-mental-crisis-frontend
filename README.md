### Purpose:
The app is called “Help Me” and is designed primarily as an “SOS” (distress signal) to a selected circle of trusted people when someone is going through a mental health crisis. The goal is for the user to build a trusted community around themselves with private conversations and provide a system to show the user's range of emotions.

### Motivation:

The ultimate motivation was to provide support to our friends and family who suffer from mental health issues. 

### This app was built with the following technologies:

**Angular:** A JavaScript framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.

**JavaScript:** Object-oriented programming language for web pages

**HTML:** Mark-up language for creating web pages

**CSS:** A formatting language for styling web pages

**MongoDB:** A document (NoSQL) database that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas

**DigitalOcean App Platform:** Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering that allows developers to publish code directly to DigitalOcean servers without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
